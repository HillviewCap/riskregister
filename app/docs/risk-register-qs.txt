Risk Treatment, and Information Sharing Ensure Value and Risk Optimization Select Risk Response After selecting and implementing controls and other methods of risk treatment, system-level personnel assess the effectiveness and efficiency of that treatment (e.g., through the Assess step of the NIST Risk Management Framework). Risk managers evaluate threats and opportunities, in alignment with risk strategy and direction from enterprise- and organization-level guidance. They determine the benefits of the following responses: Mitigate, Accept, Avoid, and Transfer for negative risks; Realize, Share, Enhance, and Accept for positive risks. Analyze and Prioritize Risks There are benefits to both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis methodologies and even the use of multiple methodologies, based on enterprise strategy, organization preference, and data availability (ID.RA). The relative priority of various types of risk must be decided upon by those with appropriate authority, usually through guidance provided through the risk management strategy (GV.RM). Communicate Risk Findings and Decisions The cybersecurity risk register (CSRR) provides a location to record and communicate the known system-level threats and vulnerabilities, their impact on business objectives, and actions taken or planned. Risk managers share information about residual risk, including metrics that support ongoing assessment and authorization, and plans of actions & milestones for maintaining the appropriate level of risk based on stakeholdersâ€™ expectations (as expressed in the target state of the Organizational Profiles, especially the Govern and Identify functions).
